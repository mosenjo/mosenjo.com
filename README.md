This is the source code for [https://mosenjo.com](https://mosenjo.com), a minimalist site for a not-so-minimalist mind. It's where biography gets confused with mischief, and where Lisy (yes, *that* Lisy) occasionally shows up uninvited.

## âœ¨ About the site
- Personal portfolio of Mose Njo
- Project showcase, storytelling breadcrumbs, and secret doorways
- Built with plain HTML/CSS/JS â€” the old-fashioned, suspiciously future-proof way

## ðŸ”§ Tech stack
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Custom domain via Porkbun
- Maintained between moments of wandering
